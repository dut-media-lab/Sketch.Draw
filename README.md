Sketch.Draw is a hand-drawn creation software based on sketch recognition technology. It runs on Android devices (we will provide iOS version soon). 

Now you can download and use it through this Repository. The implementation of this application is based on the paper "Coupling Deep Textural and Shape Features for Sketch Recognition".

The use of this software can refer to "Software User Manual.PDF".

For more implementation algorithms of the software, you can read the paper "Coupling Deep Textural and Shape Features for Sketch Recognition".
